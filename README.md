# How do our bots work?

We run the bots inside a free-tier [Space](https://huggingface.co/new-space), which acts as a server. 


-> Instructions on having their own bots
# Building blocks of bots

-> The discord end (an application associated with a discord account)
https://discord.com/developers/applications

-> Commands (to make the bot do something)
-> Events (to automate some behavior)
-> HF Space (to host the bot for free)
